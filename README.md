# Project

The Photorealistic Avatar challenge testset consists of videos from different people and is divided into two parts:
- The 1st part is the initial set provided during the start of the challenge. This has videos from 5 different persons.
- The 2nd part is another set of videos from 10 different persons, provided 1 week before the challenge submissions.

The initial set of URLs are found in the file [InitialSet.txt](https://github.com/microsoft/PhotorealisticAvatarChallenge/blob/main/InitialSet.txt) and the final set of URLs in the file FinalSet.txt
